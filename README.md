# WAlert
WAlert is a real-time alert monitoring bot that checks for Red Alert notifications from the Oref website and sends them to designated WhatsApp numbers using the Green API. This tool is ideal for users who need immediate notifications for specific regions in Israel, with options to include or exclude test alerts.



## Overview
WAlert is a Python-based bot that monitors alert notifications from the [Oref](https://www.oref.org.il/heb) Website and forwards them via WhatsApp using the [Green API](https://green-api.com/). The bot categorizes and formats alerts, sending them to designated WhatsApp numbers in real-time. You can configure it to monitor specific regions and choose whether or not to receive test alerts.


## Prerequisites
* Python 3.10+ (For manual installation)
* Docker (For containerized installation)

## Installation Options
You can install WAlert using either a Docker container or set it up as a systemd service for manual deployment.

### Option 1: Docker Installation

1. Pull the Docker Image
Pull the pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull techblog/walert:latest
```

2. Run the Docker Container
Run the Docker container with your required environment variables:

```bash
docker run -d \
    -e DEBUG_MODE="False" \
    -e REGION="*" \
    -e INCLUDE_TEST_ALERTS="False" \
    -e GREEN_API_INSTANCE="your_green_api_instance" \
    -e GREEN_API_TOKEN="your_green_api_token" \
    -e WHATSAPP_NUMBER="your_whatsapp_number" \
    --name walert your-dockerhub-user/walert:latest
```

3. Docker Compose.
You can also use docker-compose for more complex setups or for easier management:

```yaml
version: "3.6"
services:
  walert:
    image: your-dockerhub-user/walert:latest
    container_name: walert
    restart: always
    environment:
      - DEBUG_MODE=False
      - REGION=*
      - INCLUDE_TEST_ALERTS=False
      - GREEN_API_INSTANCE=your_green_api_instance
      - GREEN_API_TOKEN=your_green_api_token
      - WHATSAPP_NUMBER=your_whatsapp_number
```

To run with docker-compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation (Systemd Service)

1. Clone the Repository or Download the ZIP Package. 
You can clone the repository from GitHub or download the ZIP package:

```bash
# Clone via Git
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/walert.git
cd walert

# Alternatively, download and extract the ZIP package
curl -LO https://github.com/your-repo/walert/archive/main.zip
unzip main.zip
cd walert-main
```

2. Install Python Dependencies. Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed. Use pip to install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a .env File  file in the root directory to configure environment variables. This file will contain sensitive information like your Green API credentials and WhatsApp number.

```bash
touch .env
```

Add the following to your .env file:

```makefile
DEBUG_MODE=False
REGION=*
INCLUDE_TEST_ALERTS=False
GREEN_API_INSTANCE=your_green_api_instance
GREEN_API_TOKEN=your_green_api_token
WHATSAPP_NUMBER=your_whatsapp_number
```

4. Create a Systemd Service: To run the bot automatically as a service, you can configure it as a systemd service.

    * Create a new service file:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/walert.service
    ```
     * Add the following configuration:
     ```ini
     [Unit]
    Description=WAlert - WhatsApp bot for Red Alert alarms
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=your-username
    WorkingDirectory=/path/to/walert
    EnvironmentFile=/path/to/walert/.env
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/walert/main.py
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=5

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
    * Replace /path/to/walert with the actual path to your WAlert directory and your-username with your system username.

    * Reload systemd, enable, and start the service:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable walert
    sudo systemctl start walert
    ```
    * Check the service status:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status walert
    ```
